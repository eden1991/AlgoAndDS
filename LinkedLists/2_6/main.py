# Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning
# of the loop.
# DEFINITION
# Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an
# earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
# EXAMPLE
# input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
# output: C
